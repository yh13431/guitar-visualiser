## About The Project

I created this app so I could familiarise myself with my six string guitar fretboard, and  I still use it currently.

![mode](https://github.com/yh13431/guitar-visualiser/assets/106964833/8a09ea00-1200-4fd6-86e4-6fed7dd3a185)

![chord](https://github.com/yh13431/guitar-visualiser/assets/106964833/38e49f79-26b7-4edf-bb64-bd180311d9d6)

Users can select their desired key, scale and mode, and all the relevant notes will be mapped out on the fretboard on the same page. 

Root notes are highlighted. 

Each scale has its own chord progression, and users can also view the notes that make up each chord.

## Built With

This web app was written in Javascript and built with React.
