## About The Project

This web application was created so I could familiarise myself with my six string guitar fretboard. I still use it currently.

![mode](https://github.com/yh13431/guitar-visualiser/assets/106964833/8a09ea00-1200-4fd6-86e4-6fed7dd3a185)

![chord](https://github.com/yh13431/guitar-visualiser/assets/106964833/38e49f79-26b7-4edf-bb64-bd180311d9d6)

Users can select their desired key, scale and mode, and all the relevant notes will be mapped out on the fretboard on the same page. 

Root notes are highlighted. 

Each scale has its own chord progression, and users can also view the notes that make up each chord.
